###### [full binary tree: ] 
 - a binary tree of h that contains exactly(2^h)-1 elements is called a full binary tree.
```bash


        18
      /     \
     15     30
    /  \   /  \
  40   50 60  33
  
  ```


###### [strict binary tree] 
- each node has exactly 0 or 2 children
```bash
      18
     /   \
    15    30
   /  \
  40   50
```  
 
##### [complete binary tree] 
- a binary tree is compolete tree is all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the las level has all keys as left as possible
```bash
            18
         /     \
         15     30 
       /   \    / \
      40    50  9 22
     / \   /
    5  4  12
